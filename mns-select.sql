I have considered all null situtations, including provider title, first name and last name.

Given a provider may charge more or less than the standard fee for a service carried out
during an appointment, the MNS administration is interested in finding out what variations
on the fee have been charged across all appointments. The clinic terms the difference
between the average actual charged service fee and the service standard fee as the
"Service Fee Differential"
. For all services which have been carried out during an
appointment, determine the service fee differential. The list should show the service code,
description, standard fee and the service fee differential in service code order.
For example service D001 Oral Examination has a standard fee of $65.00, it may have
been charged on average across all appointments for $75.00 - the fee differential here will
be 75 - 65 that is a fee differential +10.00. If the average charge had been say 57.50 the
fee differential will be -7.50.
